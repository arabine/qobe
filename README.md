# What is qobe

'qobe' is a fixed structure static blog engine with only one CSS file to customize. Features:

- A blog engine in one C++ file
- Compile and run it: `g++ qobe && ./a.out ./docs/blog ./output`
- First argument is the blog input directory, each article in dedicated subdirectory along with images, named index.md
- Supports YAML header (date and title)

Example:

```
docs/blog
      | entry-1
           |__ index.md
           |__ image1.png
```

# Customize

## CSS style

You must provide a `style.css` at the directory root of your blog. If none found, a default one is generated. See C++ code to look at extra classes used in addition to standard HTML tags (H1, pre, p ...)

## Custom header

If a file named `header.html` is found at the directory root of your blog, it will be inseted on top of each pages.

# That's all

Yes, no configuration file, it's enough generic for a simple blog. The C++ code has been heavily generated by IA.
